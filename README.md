The concept of social capital came from the desire to study the economy and how it works by treating things that have an effect on economies but whose value is difficult to consider in monetary terms as a type of capital. **Social capital** is especially concerned with treating the relationships between people and others, and between people and society as a form of capital. Abundance of social capital has shown number of social and economic effects, for example, increased political participation improvements in the effects of children’s education, improvements in public order, expansion of local economies, improvements in the health of local residents, and a number other positive economic and societal effects.
Through the creation of a token economy, social capital can be directly recorded and visualized, changing the world for the better. 
The users of **Findacial** will be able to act as a community and exchange feelings such as _“gratitude”_, _“empathy”_ and _“support”_. The history of these exchanges is recorded as social capital, which becomes the basis for trust relationships for people. As a result, actions that deviate from normative morals will be suppressed, the costs incurred by doubting other people will be removed and the effectiveness of societies will overall be improved. We will be able to create a future where, by verifying the trust accumulated through the people’s positive acts, it will become possible for example, for people to find like-minded and trustworthy business partners without having to expend large amounts of time, effort or money in order to do so.
